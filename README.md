# Retail-Dashboard
This repository has a retail analytics dashboard of 2 chains in Australia.
For this dashboard I decided to look at the managers in the chains . I realised that managers were allocated a number of suburbs to manage. I looked at the extremes of the spectrum. I looked at the managers with the highest and lowest number of suburbs.  I realised that although on face value, the managers with highest number of suburbs to manage were giving good profit returns. However the managers with fewer suburbs had greater returns as compared to this. It is a recommendation that the chains reduce the number of suburbs each manager is in charge of to drive profuts. 
Another thing we looked at was the Sales by buyer visualization on Page 2. The insights derived were that although Bruce Curran had a high profit percent. Upon further investigation I realised that although buyers like Maggie, Sara and Ella looked like their profit was smaller on the visualization. It is seen that these buyers had higher profit percents than Ben and also the producs they were buying did not need soo much investment but still yielded great profit. A recommendation was for the chains to invest more in these products and also try and get more buyers interested in these products.
